The A+ and A had to catch the C's then catch the B's and then lap the C's
to win the race. John Jones, Frank Eyth, Skip Rogers and Dave Hickey
stayed with the A's the first time the A's caught the C's. The combined
A's and C's caught the B's. The four C riders were one lap up. Rogers
and Hickey were later dropped. Jones and Eyth stayed with the A's and 
were one lap up, taking the race by losing less than the 3:27 handicap.
