<P>
Races were cancelled due to the Zoo being rented to Coldwell 
Banker for the evening. Since no reasonable prior notice was given to ACA of 
the event (rumor has it the Michelle Matic was notified at 8AM on Wednesday), 
the regular crowd showed up for the race.
</P>
<P>
Those who decided on an alternate ride, split into two main groups: one led 
by Ryan McDermitt and Rob Gaus did sprints around the Highland Park resevoir, 
the second led by Tim Lyons and me did a 41 mile group ride out Saxonburg Blvd, 
Middle Rd and West Deer. The second group started with approximately <B>40</B>
 riders and finished with about 21 in the main pack, with several groups 
splitting off during the ride. The weather was pleasant, there 
was little traffic, the motorists were relatively courteous and the route was 
mainly rolling, with a great downhill finish on Saxonburg composed of a 21 
person paceline at 35 mph.

<P>
It was the largest group ride at that speed I'd ever particapated in and 
for a small moment in Pittsburgh history (two hours)...<BR>
