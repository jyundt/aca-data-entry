   Races were cancelled due to the Zoo being rented to Coldwell Banker for the evening. Since no reasonable prior notice was given to ACA of the event (rumor has it the Michelle Matic was notified at 8AM on Wednesday), the regular crowd showed up for the race.

   Those who decided on an alternate ride, split into two main groups: one led by Ryan McDermitt and Rob Gaus did sprints around the Highland Park resevoir, the second led by Tim Lyons and me did a 41 mile group ride out Saxonburg Blvd, Middle Rd and West Deer. The second group started with approximately 40 riders and finished with about 21 in the main pack, with several groups splitting off during the ride. The weather was pleasant, there was little traffic, the motorists were relatively courteous and the route was mainly rolling, with a great downhill finish on Saxonburg composed of a 21 person paceline at 35 mph.

   It was the largest group ride at that speed I'd ever particapated in and for a small moment in Pittsburgh history (two hours)...
   We ruled the roads!
