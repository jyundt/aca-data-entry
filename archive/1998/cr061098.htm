<B>WARNING: This report contains a personal editorial (as do all reports) 
and in no way reflects the official position of the board of directors of 
the Allegheny Cycling Association. However, based on email I've received 
it DOES reflect the official opinion of all of the board members I've 
heard from.</B>
</P>
As most of you know, there are no results to be posted because the zoo
officials cancelled our race <B>WITHOUT NOTIFICATION</B>! Our "deal" with 
the zoo is that they reserve the right to cancel any race without notification 
(their terms not ours), which they exercised. However, any notification, no 
matter how late in the day, is a matter of common courtesy. 
</P>
<P>
As I was arriving, I noticed three zoo guards speaking with several of the 
early arrivers. The reason they gave for the cancellation was that there was 
a big "gala" that the zoo had to prepare for and that there would be zoo people 
coming and going from the parking lot all evening. I also noticed in the 
newspaper that one of the national TV network's news shows (I think ABC) 
will be broadcasting the weather from the zoo on Friday. Perhaps this is the 
gala the guards referred to. I, as do many others, have a hard time believing 
that the zoo did not know of this gala far enough in advance to let someone at 
ACA know about it. They know who to contact. I'm left with the impression that 
this was a premeditated and malicious act. They unnecessarily inconvenienced 
at least 60 racers, most of whose tax dollars help support the zoo and ALL of 
whose entry fees and membership dues are used to provide an annual fee to the 
zoo for the privilege of racing there. It's not so much a matter of not being 
able to race as it is a matter of courtesy. After all it's the zoo's parking 
lot (actually it's the city's) and I have to conceed that if an organization 
wishes to rent the zoo on Wed. evening then too bad ACA. The zoo provides a 
valuable cultural service to the community and I realize it cannot turn away 
any income it can get. Plus the zoo would say it would be a poor public 
relations and business decision to turn away potential rentors for the sake 
of 100 bike racers. But I would further ask the following question of Dr. 
Baker: How would you and the other zoo officials feel if ABC just didn't 
show WITHOUT notification?
</P>
<P>
If you wish to write or call to complain the zoo's phone number is 412/665-3640  
and their address is Pittsburgh Zoo, 1 Hill Road, Pittsburgh 15206. Dr. Barbara 
Baker's the CEO and president. The PR email address is jennifer@zoo.pgh.pa.us.

In lieu of the races, a group of about 40 riders toured Saxonburg Blvd, Middle 
Road and West Deer Twp, while others rode around at the Highland Park resevoir.
<B>There will be NO race on June 17</B>..the zoo DID notify us about this one. 
If you would like to partcipate in another group ride, meet at the entrance of 
the Highland Park resevoir no later than 6:15 PM. There will be rides of lengths 
from about 25 miles to 45 miles.
