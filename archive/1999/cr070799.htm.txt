   On June 30, the ACA purchased a digital camera from Sony to assist in picking race results. Because of the layout of the course, low light conditions and seemingly larger and regular mass sprint finishes, manual picking has been difficult. Not to mention the fact that finding pickers is always a hassle. While manual picking has not been eliminated, the camera will be used to arbitrate and verify results. Tonight marks the first time the camera was used to assist the officials. You'll notice that the results are much deeper than previous weeks'.
