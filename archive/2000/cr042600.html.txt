   50 degF clear and cold
   USCF Permit #2000-000401

   Check out photos of the race at www.paoutside.com.

   To all team leaders:
   Usually I hang around after the races to get the results so they can be posted as early as possible on Thursday AM. Since time usually doesn't permit, I cannot register team affiliations with the riders. I'd like to post teams with the riders names, so if one person could email me team rosters, I'll use them for the results.

   Thanks,
   Jack Neyer email: jneyer@gopolar.com
