   Pittsburgh New Racers Night
   Our inaugural New Racers Night was cool and mercifully dry, a beautiful evening to be on the bike. 27 riders participated, including 11 women and 5 juniors. We look forward to seeing progressively more of these new racers in future weeks. The Skills Clinic emphasized riding in a safe yet effective draft position, holding a line, and communication among the group. Thanks to Armando Rotundi, Jody Lobert, Ruud VanDijk, Jack Neyer and Glenn Snyder for helping out as our coach/marshalls. Next week, the East Suburban Sports Medicine team will marshall. Hope to see you there!
