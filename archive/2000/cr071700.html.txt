   Pittsburgh New Racers Night
   WHAT A JOY TO HAVE A BEAUTIFUL MONDAY EVENING ONCE AGAIN. (yes, I made a deal with the Devil to get Wednesday weather, now they have ours...)

   Monday, July 17, it was once again a pleasure to see you all racing. I've received a number of positive reactions to the Points Race format, and have been promising that we'll do it again. This sort of sprinting practice can be very valuable in one's racing, especially having experience sprinting on that particular course. And it's the sort of interval workout that we all have trouble forcing upon ourselves.

   Thanks to Oscar, Jody and Andrew of PMVC for chasing these folks around as our Marshals the day after a tough road race.

   Women: we are now getting 5-6 women showing up for the ACA Wednesday night criteriums, so there seems to be another regular race available to you. (some kinks in the combined event with C riders, but we'll work these out).

   Next week we will begin with 1-mile time trials (optional), in preparation for another full TT event on July 31. Clinic (mercifully brief) will begin at aprx. 6:20 pm. And women will get to race first.
