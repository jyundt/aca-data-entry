   Some of you may know me as the announcer on Monday nights. If not, you soon will, as I will be taking over for Dave Curry from now on.

   Dave did a fine job and I don't plan to make any major changes. however, I would like to run events on a slighty tighter schedule, as that's my nature. Also, I want to maximize the investment in time that the racers, spectators and volunteers make when they come to the oval. The numbers we saw last Monday night were very encouraging.

   With that in mind, here's what I plan on, starting the 9th:
     * Registration - 5:45-6:30
     * New rider training - 6:30-6:55
     * Race start - 7:00

   The first rider training will consist of a a short talk on pacelines, a Q&A to see what the masses want on later nights, and a quick check to make sure all numbers are pinned in the manner Dave showed us last Monday night. I'll make every effort to keep to these times so you can plan your warm-up, nutrition and the like.

   Thanks to those who come down and thanks to those who are letting me help. See you monday.
